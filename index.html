	<h2>Me and my experience:</h2>
	<p>I love to learn and create. I was born in Boston, transplanted to central Florida for my formative years, and find myself once again in wonderful New England looking for the right opportunity to move from programing enthusiast to practicing developer. I was introduced to Python and C++ while studying Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Since then, I've done some independent study in the field, including reading "Digital Design and Computer Architecture," through which I learned a bit about C, assembly languages, and how they communicate with the machine down to the lowest levels of logic gates and transistors. I've had some time to play around on Project Euler where users solve increasingly difficult math puzzles through programming and am currently working through a computer science course on edX.com. In my free time I paint in oils, acrylics, and digitally with Photoshop and Procreate. I also enjoy woodworking, and 3d modeling/sculpting with programs like Maya and Mudbox.</p>
